            <article>
                <p>HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
                    Group, an organization formed by people working on the most popular web browser. This means it's
                    basically controlled by Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft.</p>

                <p>In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organization in charge of creating the HTML
                    standard.</p>

                <p>The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the W3C push towards XHTML
                    was
                    not a good idea.</p>

                <p>If you've never heard of XHTML, here's a short story. In the early 2000s, we
                    all believed the future of the Web was XML (seriously). So HTML moved
                    from being an SGML-based authoring language to an XML markup language.
                </p>

                <p>It was a big change. We had to know, and respect, more rules. Stricter rules.</p>

                <p>Eventually browser vendors realized this was not the right path for the Web,
                    and they pushed back, creating what is now known as HTML5.</p>
                <p>W3C did not really agree on giving up control of HTML, and for years we had
                    2 competing standards, each one aiming to be the official one. Eventually on
                    28 May 2019 it was made official by W3C that the "true" HTML version was
                    the one published by WHATWG.</p>
                <p>HTML5 is a term that now defines a whole set of technologies, which
                    includes HTML but adds a lot of APIs and standards like WebGL, SVG and
                    more.</p>
                <p>The key thing to understand here is this: there is no such thing (any more) as
                    an HTML version now.</p>
                <p>HTML is the markup language we use to structure content that we consume
                    on the Web.

            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Page Structure</strong>
                        Things start with the Document Type Declaration (aka doctype), a way to tell
                        the browser this is an HTML page, and which version of HTML we are using. Then we have the html
                        element, which has an opening and closing tag: we also have the head and body element.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tags vs elements</strong>
                        Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag</li>
                    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>
                        The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach, called
                        attributes. Attributes have the key="value" syntax:</li>
                    <li><strong> Case insensitive</strong>
                        HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase. In the early days, caps
                        were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a convention</li>
                    <li><strong>White space</strong>
                        Pretty important. In HTML, even if you add multiple white spaces into a line,
                        it's collapsed by the browser's CSS engine.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <!-- html header section -->
        <section class="main-section" id="html_header">
            <header>HTML Header</header>
            <article>
                Inside the Document we have the Document Heading
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "title" tag</strong>
                        The title tag determines the page title. The title is displayed in the
                        browser, and it's especially important as it's one of the key factors for Search
                        Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
                    <li><strong>The "script" tag</strong>
                        This tag is used to add JavaScript into the page.
                        You can include it inline, using an opening tag, the JavaScript code and then
                        the closing tag:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;script>
                                    ..some JS
                                &lt;/script>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        Or you can load an external JavaScript file by using the src attribute:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;script src="file.js">&lt;script>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The "noscript" tag</strong>
                        This tag is used to detect when scripts are disabled in the browser. It is used differently
                        depending on whether it's put in the document head or
                        in the document body.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "link" tag</strong>
                        The link tag is used to set relationships between a document and other
                        resources.
                        It's mainly used to link an external CSS file to be loaded.
                        This element has no closing tag.
                        Usage:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
                                    &lt;html>
                                        &lt;head>
                                        ...
                                        &lt;link href="file.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
                                        ...
                                        &lt;/head>
                                        ...
                                    &lt;/html>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The "style" tag</strong>
                        This tag can be used to add styles into the document, rather than loading an
                        external stylesheet.
                        Usage:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;style>
                                    ..some-css
                                &lt;/style>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        As with the link tag, you can use the media attribute to use that CSS only
                        on the specified medium:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;style media="print">
                                .some-css {
                                }
                                &lt;/style>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The "base" tag</strong>
                        This tag is used to set a base URL for all relative URLs contained in the page
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
                                &lt;html>
                                    &lt;head>
                                    ...
                                    &lt;base href="https://loremipsum.com/"/>
                                    ...
                                    &lt;/head>
                                    ...
                                &lt;/html>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The "meta" tag</strong>
                        Meta tags perform a variety of tasks and they are very, very important</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <!-- html document body section -->
        <section class="main-section" id="html_document_body">
            <header>HTML Document Body</header>
            <article>
                After the closing head tag, we can only have one thing in an HTML
                document: the body element.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
                            &lt;html>
                                &lt;head>
                                ...
                                &lt;/head>
                                &lt;body>
                                ...
                                &lt;/body>
                            &lt;/html>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                Just like the head and html tags, we can only have one body tag in one
                page.
                Inside the body tag we have all the tags that define the content of the page.
                Technically, the start and ending tags are optional. But I consider it a good
                practice to add them. Just for clarity.
                In the next chapters we'll define the variety of tags you can use inside the
                page body.
                But before, we must introduce a difference between block elements and
                inline elements.
